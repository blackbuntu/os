## Farewell Blackbuntu, Hello SnoopGod Linux!

We wanted to share a bit of backstory and an update on a project we've been involved with for some time now. Some of you might remember Blackbuntu, a Linux distribution born in 2011 but unfortunately abandoned by its original developer a few years later. In 2018, We took on the responsibility of maintaining and reviving Blackbuntu, but encountered a hurdle with the domain name.

When we resurrected the project, we purchased blackbuntu.org to provide a platform for its continued development. However, there was already an existing blackbuntu.com owned by someone else, causing confusion among users and potential contributors.

We made the decision in 2023 to transition away from Blackbuntu and introduce a new project called "SnoopGod Linux." While it's essentially the spiritual successor to Blackbuntu, SnoopGod Linux features a significant change. The major update is the switch from the Gnome desktop environment to KDE Plasma. This change not only provides a fresh user experience but also aligns more closely with the direction we envisioned for the project.

You can find more about the project in our website [snoopgod.com](https://snoopgod.com). All your remarks and suggestion are most welcome.
